# NetMon is a small Network monitor for Roadshow

These are the sources for my NetMon Network Monitor.

The code can be compiled on AmigaOS 3.x (SAS-C 6.58) with the following command:

```
smake
```

To build the code for AmigaOS 4.x (gcc) just enter:

```
make
```

Please note that you need the Roadshow SDK installed to successfully compile this code on both platforms!

The original release archive can be found on my homepage:

Way back in 2006 I've also worked on an AmiDock version of NetMon,
unfortunately my A1 just died some weeks after the 0.34 release
of this tool, so this was never completed.
The sources are inside the docky/ folder.



Have fun,
